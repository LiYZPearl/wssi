Wave-structure-soil interaction 

This is a one-way coupling wave-structure-soil interaction toolbox for wave-induced seabed response around coastal and offshore structures. The soil solvers include liquefaction analysis with various liquefaction criteria. 

For any usage of these models please refer to
