Application
    anisotropicBiotLiqueFoam

Description
    Segregated finite-volume solver for poro-linear-elastic,
    small-strain deformation of a soil material, with mechanical anisotropy
    (in particular, the orthotropy with 9 independent parameters) and hydraulic 
    anisotropy (directional-different soil permeability).

    Note that a new sigma_S field is added to facilitate a displacement boundary 
    condtion, timeVaryingMappedTotalTraction, which can describe a time and spatial 
    varying traction load (e.g. from the structure). This bc is derived from 
    tractionDisplacement + timeVaryingMappedFixedValue in OpenFOAM.   

    Liquefaction analysis based on the vertical initial effective stress which is 
    calculated from the consolidation solver or the soil self weight. If a gravity
    structure is placed on the seabed, consolidation analysis must be performed by 
    using the consolidation solver. Then copy the initEffSigmazz into the 0/ folder.
