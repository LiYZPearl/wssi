Note that in boundaryData, the weight from the berm is added through the vairable p (pore pressure). 

A more physically correct way is to add the external gravity force through sigma_S (same as that in 1DTersigi tutorial). 

This is because sigma_S acts on the soil skeleton, while p acts on the pore water.
